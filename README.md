\## Setup and Code Execution Instructions



First, go to the tools directory and click on the install\_hugo.bat file.

This will automatically install Hugo, a tool that is essential for building and running the website.



After installing Hugo, you can build the website. While still in the tools directory, click on build.dat. It will ask you which type of build you want:

1\.  server: This will build and run a server for testing on localhost.

2\.  publish build: This is ideal for uploading to your web server.

3\.  delete built directories: If you have already built, executed, or published, you can delete these directories to make the source code lighter.



If you only want to execute the code, choose option 1.



Enter 1, and it will build the server at localhost:1313. Go to that address to view it, or press Ctrl+C to shut down the server.



\## How to Contribute



First: read the \[Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) or ask an AI. Then, find the source directory. This is the entire source code and configuration.



\## Warning and Notes



If you have malicious intentions, such as taking the source code to run on a public server, and then publish your website, I will ban you from this project if I find out.



Please download the source code to contribute or test. Please, and I implore you, have no malicious intent.
