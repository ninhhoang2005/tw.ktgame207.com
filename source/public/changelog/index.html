<li>removed the old bgt audio library, and rewrote the audio system with the modern nvgt library, and we are closer to hrtf</li>
<li>added the check for sound update feature, it has been divided into two versions, client update and sound update, these are two different things, client update is for the client, and for sound update, when there are new sounds, we will update them and you will proceed to download them</li>
