<h2 id="changelog">changelog</h2>
<p>All changes will be posted here.</p>
<h2 id="update-to-version-1403">update to version 14.03</h2>
<p>Added Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) via Telegram to enhance account security.
New command <code>tglogin</code>:
<code>tglogin</code>: Toggles the 2FA feature on or off for your account. Before use, you must link your Telegram ID with the command <code>settelegram &lt;your_id&gt;</code>.
<code>tglogin &lt;number&gt;</code>: Allows you to set a number of &ldquo;grace logins&rdquo; that will not require a confirmation code. For example, <code>tglogin 5</code> will skip the code prompt for the next 5 logins. This option is only available when 2FA is enabled.
With 2FA enabled, you will receive a private message on Telegram with a 6-digit code, valid for 10 minutes, when you log in.
If you interrupt your login, the same code will be required for any login attempt within the 10-minute window.
Refactored the item auction UI:
Replaced the old, separate input dialogs with a single, modern form.
This provides a more intuitive and streamlined experience for listing items on the auction.
Fixed coordinate display issue across maps.
Implemented a hotkey for auction bidding:
Players can now press Shift+B to quickly place bids in auctions.
A numeric-only input field ensures that only valid bid amounts can be entered.
This feature provides a seamless and error-free way to participate in auctions.
Implemented connection sound feedback with toggle and improved reconnection:
Added dynamic sound feedback (beeps with increasing pitch) during client login, providing audio cues for connection status, progress, and errors.
Tuned beep sounds to match GL project&rsquo;s tonality (waveform type 4, custom edge fades) and increased their volume for better audibility.
Introduced an &rsquo;enable_connection_beeps&rsquo; setting, allowing users to toggle these sounds on or off from the options menu.
Implemented automatic reconnection for player sessions when the server exits (e.g., via &rsquo;exit&rsquo; command), eliminating the blocking &lsquo;dlg&rsquo; message and ensuring players automatically reconnected once the server is active again.
Implemented autologin feature with configurable toggle:
Added an &lsquo;autologin&rsquo; feature that allows users to bypass the main menu and automatically log into the game upon client startup.
Ensured autologin triggers after essential startup checks (e.g., updates), maintaining game integrity.
Integrated &lsquo;autologin&rsquo; into the configuration system, allowing its state to be persisted across sessions.
Added a toggle for &lsquo;autologin&rsquo; in the options menu, providing users with control over this convenience feature.
Fixed an &ldquo;Out of range&rdquo; error:
Resolved an &ldquo;Out of range&rdquo; error in text processing related to newlines, ensuring more stable text input and display.</p>
